# Kundalini Yoga

This is a comprehensive guide to creating a Kundalini Yoga website using HTML, CSS, and a touch of Font Awesome. The website includes three main pages: Home, Yoga, and Contact. The Home page introduces Kundalini Yoga, the Yoga page delves into the practice and its benefits, and the Contact page allows users to get in touch.

## UX (User Experience)

The user experience is designed to be intuitive and engaging. The website features a clean layout, easy-to-read typography, and a calming color scheme. Users can easily navigate between pages using the navigation bar, and the content is structured to provide a logical flow of information.

## User Stories

## Strategy

The goal of this project is to create an informative and engaging website about Kundalini Yoga. The website should appeal to users who are interested in yoga, meditation, and personal growth.

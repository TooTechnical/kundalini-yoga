## Deployment

## Deployment Guide for Kundalini Yoga Website on GitHub Pages

In this section, I'll share how I deployed my Kundalini Yoga website project using GitHub Pages. Follow these steps if you'd like to replicate the process for your own project:

1. **Creating a GitHub Repository**
   - Initially, I needed a place to host my project files. I created a repository on GitHub by clicking the "New repository" button on my dashboard, ensuring the repository name reflected my project.

2. **Preparing the Project**
   - My project's main entry point is the `index.html` file, which is located at the root of the project structure. I organized all related files (like CSS, and images) within the repository to keep things tidy.

3. **Pushing the Project to GitHub**
   - To get my project onto GitHub, I started by initializing a Git repository in my project directory with `git init`.
   - I added all my files to the staging area with `git add .` and committed them with `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.
   - I then linked my local repository to the remote GitHub repository using `git remote add origin [URL of your GitHub repository]` and pushed my changes with `git push -u origin master`.

4. **Enabling GitHub Pages**
   - On the GitHub site, in my repository's "Settings" tab, I scrolled down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - I selected the `master` branch as the source and saved my settings, which immediately made GitHub Pages active for my repository.

5. **Custom Domain Configuration (Optional)**
   - I wanted my project to have a professional look with a custom domain, so under the same "GitHub Pages" settings, I added my custom domain in the "Custom domain" section.

6. **Accessing the Website**
   - After setting everything up, my site was available at `(https://tootechnical.github.io/kundalini-yoga/index.html)<repository>`. 
7. **Updating the Site**
   - To keep my site up-to-date, I regularly push new changes to the `master` branch. Each push automatically updates the live website, ensuring visitors always see the latest content.

By following these steps, I successfully deployed the Kundalini Yoga website on GitHub Pages, making it accessible to users worldwide. GitHub Pages is an excellent tool for hosting static websites like mine.

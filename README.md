Overview

Welcome to the Kundalini Yoga project! This project is aimed at providing resources, guidance, and tools for practicing Kundalini Yoga, a spiritual practice that combines physical postures, breathing techniques, meditation, and chanting.

About Kundalini Yoga

Kundalini Yoga is a form of yoga that focuses on the awakening of the Kundalini energy, which is believed to be located at the base of the spine. Through various practices such as asana (physical postures), pranayama (breathing techniques), meditation, and mantra chanting, practitioners aim to awaken and raise this energy through the chakras, leading to spiritual enlightenment and self-realization.

            <h2>Sun Kriya</h2>


            <p>Sun Kriya is a specific yoga practice that involves a series of movements and breathing techniques aimed
                at energizing the body and balancing the solar energy within. It is often practiced in the morning to
                harness the vitality and power of the sun. Sun Kriya typically includes dynamic movements, such as
                stretching and bending, combined with rhythmic breathing patterns. This practice is believed to
                stimulate the solar plexus chakra, promoting confidence, strength, and mental clarity. It is also said
                to improve digestion, boost metabolism, and enhance overall well-being. Sun Kriya is a powerful way to
                start the day with a sense of vitality and positivity.</p>

            <h2>Learn the Pranayama</h2>
            <p>Pranayama is a fundamental aspect of yoga practice that focuses on controlling the breath to enhance
                physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. The word "pranayama" is derived from two Sanskrit words:
                "prana," meaning life force or vital energy, and "ayama," meaning expansion or extension. Together, they
                imply the expansion and regulation of the life force through breath control.</p>


            <p>In pranayama, practitioners use various breathing techniques to manipulate the flow of prana within the
                body. This may involve regulating the inhalation, exhalation, and retention of breath in specific
                patterns and rhythms. Pranayama techniques can range from simple, mindful breathing exercises to more
                complex practices involving specific ratios of inhalation, exhalation, and breath retention.

                <h2>Sun Kriya</h2>


                <p>Sun Kriya is a specific yoga practice that involves a series of movements and breathing techniques
                    aimed
                    at energizing the body and balancing the solar energy within. It is often practiced in the morning
                    to
                    harness the vitality and power of the sun. Sun Kriya typically includes dynamic movements, such as
                    stretching and bending, combined with rhythmic breathing patterns. This practice is believed to
                    stimulate the solar plexus chakra, promoting confidence, strength, and mental clarity. It is also
                    said
                    to improve digestion, boost metabolism, and enhance overall well-being. Sun Kriya is a powerful way
                    to
                    start the day with a sense of vitality and positivity.</p>

                <h2>Learn the Pranayama</h2>
                <p>Pranayama is a fundamental aspect of yoga practice that focuses on controlling the breath to enhance
                    physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. The word "pranayama" is derived from two Sanskrit words:
                    "prana," meaning life force or vital energy, and "ayama," meaning expansion or extension. Together,
                    they
                    imply the expansion and regulation of the life force through breath control.</p>


                <p>In pranayama, practitioners use various breathing techniques to manipulate the flow of prana within
                    the
                    body. This may involve regulating the inhalation, exhalation, and retention of breath in specific
                    patterns and rhythms. Pranayama techniques can range from simple, mindful breathing exercises to
                    more
                    complex practices involving specific ratios of inhalation, exhalation, and breath retention.

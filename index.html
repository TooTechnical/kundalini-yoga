                <h2>Origins of Kundalini Yoga</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    Kundalini Yoga traces its roots back thousands of years to ancient India, where it was initially
                    passed down orally from teacher to student. The term "Kundalini" refers to the primal energy
                    believed to reside at the base of the spine, often depicted as a coiled serpent. The goal of
                    Kundalini Yoga is to awaken and raise this dormant energy through a combination of physical
                    postures, breathing techniques, meditation, and mantra repetition.
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    Over the centuries, Kundalini Yoga evolved and adapted, drawing influences from various Indian
                    spiritual traditions such as Tantra, Hatha Yoga, and Vedanta. It wasn't until the 20th century that
                    Kundalini Yoga gained wider recognition and popularity, thanks in large part to the efforts of
                    prominent teachers such as Swami Sivananda Saraswati and Swami Vivekananda.

                <div class="content">
                    In the mid-20th century, Kundalini Yoga experienced a significant resurgence with the emergence of
                    Yogi Bhajan, a charismatic spiritual teacher from India. Yogi Bhajan is credited with bringing
                    Kundalini Yoga to the West, where it gained a dedicated following among spiritual seekers and yoga
                    enthusiasts.

                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    Yogi Bhajan founded the Kundalini Research Institute in 1969 and established the 3HO (Healthy,
                    Happy, Holy Organization) Foundation to promote the teachings of Kundalini Yoga worldwide. He
                    developed a structured system of Kundalini Yoga practices, including kriyas (specific sequences of
                    exercises), meditations, and mantra chanting, designed to awaken consciousness and facilitate
                    personal transformation.

                <div class="content">
                    Today, Kundalini Yoga continues to thrive as a dynamic and multifaceted spiritual practice,
                    attracting practitioners from all walks of life. Its emphasis on holistic well-being, spiritual
                    awakening, and self-empowerment resonates with individuals seeking deeper meaning, connection, and
                    fulfillment in their lives. As Kundalini Yoga spreads globally, it remains rooted in its ancient
                    origins while evolving to meet the needs of modern practitioners in an ever-changing world.

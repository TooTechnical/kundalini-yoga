                    <div class="content">
                        Kundalini Yoga traces its roots back thousands of years to ancient India, where it was initially
                        passed down orally from teacher to student. The term "Kundalini" refers to the primal energy
                        believed to reside at the base of the spine, often depicted as a coiled serpent. The goal of
                        Kundalini Yoga is to awaken and raise this dormant energy through a combination of physical
                        postures, breathing techniques, meditation, and mantra repetition.

                    <div class="content">
                        Over the centuries, Kundalini Yoga evolved and adapted, drawing influences from various Indian
                        spiritual traditions such as Tantra, Hatha Yoga, and Vedanta. It wasn't until the 20th century
                        that
                        Kundalini Yoga gained wider recognition and popularity, thanks in large part to the efforts of
                        prominent teachers such as Swami Sivananda Saraswati and Swami Vivekananda.

                        In the mid-20th century, Kundalini Yoga experienced a significant resurgence with the emergence
                        of
                        Yogi Bhajan, a charismatic spiritual teacher from India. Yogi Bhajan is credited with bringing
                        Kundalini Yoga to the West, where it gained a dedicated following among spiritual seekers and
                        yoga
                        enthusiasts.

                        Yogi Bhajan founded the Kundalini Research Institute in 1969 and established the 3HO (Healthy,
                        Happy, Holy Organization) Foundation to promote the teachings of Kundalini Yoga worldwide. He
                        developed a structured system of Kundalini Yoga practices, including kriyas (specific sequences
                        of
                        exercises), meditations, and mantra chanting, designed to awaken consciousness and facilitate
                        personal transformation.

                    <h2>What Is Kundalini Yoga</h2>
                    <!-- Content about Kundalini Yoga basics -->
                    <div class="content">
                        Kundalini Yoga is a spiritual and physical practice that aims to awaken the dormant energy
                        believed
                        to be coiled at the base of the spine, known as Kundalini energy. This practice has roots in
                        ancient
                        Indian tradition and is often associated with various spiritual philosophies, including Hinduism
                        and
                        Tantra.

                        The term "Kundalini" refers to the primal energy within every individual, which, when awakened,
                        can
                        lead to higher states of consciousness and spiritual enlightenment. In Kundalini Yoga,
                        practitioners
                        use a combination of physical postures (asanas), breathwork (pranayama), meditation, chanting
                        (mantra), and sometimes specific hand gestures (mudras) to awaken and raise this energy through
                        the
                        body's energy centers (chakras).

                        Kundalini Yoga is known for its dynamic and transformative nature, aiming not only for physical
                        well-being but also for spiritual growth and self-awareness. It emphasizes the connection
                        between
                        mind, body, and spirit, offering practitioners a holistic approach to health and
                        self-realization.

                        Practitioners of Kundalini Yoga often report benefits such as increased vitality, reduced
                        stress,
                        improved mental clarity, and a deeper sense of connection to oneself and the universe. It is
                        practiced by people of various backgrounds and beliefs, and its teachings are shared through
                        classes, workshops, and retreats worldwide. Watch the Youtube Video below to further learn about

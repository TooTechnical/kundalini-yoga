                    <section> Kundalini Yoga traces its roots back thousands of years to ancient India, where it was
                        initially passed down orally from teacher to student. The term "Kundalini" refers to the primal
                        energy believed to reside at the base of the spine, often depicted as a coiled serpent. The goal
                        of Kundalini Yoga is to awaken and raise this dormant energy through a combination of physical
                        postures, breathing techniques, meditation, and mantra repetition.

                    <section>Over the centuries, Kundalini Yoga evolved and adapted, drawing influences from various
                        Indian spiritual traditions such as Tantra, Hatha Yoga, and Vedanta. It wasn't until the 20th
                        century that Kundalini Yoga gained wider recognition and popularity, thanks in large part to the
                        efforts of prominent teachers such as Swami Sivananda Saraswati and Swami Vivekananda.

                            <section> In the mid-20th century, Kundalini Yoga experienced a significant resurgence with
                                the emergence of Yogi Bhajan, a charismatic spiritual teacher from India. Yogi Bhajan is
                                credited with bringing Kundalini Yoga to the West, where it gained a dedicated following
                                among spiritual seekers and yoga enthusiasts.

                            <section> Yogi Bhajan founded the Kundalini Research Institute in 1969 and established the
                                3HO (Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization) Foundation to promote the teachings of Kundalini
                                Yoga worldwide. He developed a structured system of Kundalini Yoga practices, including
                                kriyas (specific sequences of exercises), meditations, and mantra chanting, designed to
                                awaken consciousness and facilitate personal transformation.
